                Greetings, adventurer. I am the ranger who collects bear meat. You see, I really like bear meat. 
                It was my destiny to collect it. If you can bring me some bear meat, we can help each other. 
                I can UPGRADE your gear with it. Well, kinda.

              options:
                - text: Upgrade? With meat?
                  action: upgrade

            Hold one meat in your left hand, and I'll take that one plus four from your sack. 
            Hold a piece of gear with no offensive adds in your right hand, and it will be more offensive in combat!
