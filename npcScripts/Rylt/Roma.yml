                Greetings, adventurer! One of the best things you can do for yourself right now is learn how to TAN creatures.

            Yes! Many creatures have value beyond killing them, you can take their corpses to the tanner on the south side of town. 
            He can tan their hides and give you some armor in return.
            Interested? Hold the tanned hide of a deer in your right hand and I'll upgrade it for you.
