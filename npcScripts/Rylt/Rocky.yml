                Hey! You! Help! I'm trapped in here. At least I think so. Name's Rocky, I'm a golem or somethin'. 
                They made me smart and stuff but I seem to be stuck between a ROCK and a hard place. Ha ha.

            Yeah! Yeah! Get it, 'cause I'm made of rocks and we're in a place made of- nevermind. 
            Anyway, I can UPGRADE your gear to make it hard as a rock. Heh heh. 
            You might have a lil' trouble finding 'em though, I don't think these guys are as smart as me.

            Hold one golem brain in your left hand, and I'll take that one plus four from your sack. 
            Hold a piece of gear that I haven't upgraded in your right hand, and it will help you be more defensive in combat!
