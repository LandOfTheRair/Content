                Thanks, ${ name }! I've transferred the important bits to your bracers, and the rest of the skull should
                serve my research nicely.

                Greetings, adventurer. I am conducting research on the wildlife of Tutorial Island, but alas, after
                moving on I cannot go back! If you bring me a pair of golden bracers and a Tutorial Yeti Skull, I can
                transfer its enchantment to the bracers.

                - text: Sure, I can get you a skull
