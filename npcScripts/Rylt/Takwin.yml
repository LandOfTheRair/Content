                I'm Takwin, but if you're here, you probably already knew that. Telwin is the only one who knows the way here -- he did DESIGN these prisons, after all.

            Telwin is a master architect. I've seen his tribute, his altar, and I've seen what lies beneath here. Whatever it is, it must have POSSESSED Tonwin -- I don't think he could have betrayed us by himself.

            Possessed is the word I would use. Some spirit or ghost or whatever they're called came out of the Altar. It gave Tonwin a murderous look in his eye -- I've never seen anything like it. I'm afraid he must be STOPPED.

            The only way to stop him is to kill him. I wish there were another way. If you can bring me proof of his death, I can impart our family memento unto you.
