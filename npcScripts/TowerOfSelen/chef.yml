                Hail, adventurer. I know that because you don't look like you're from these parts. Anyway, I'm a chef and I create my cuisine from, er, "interesting" ingredients. For example, did you know if you mix a spider egg and an ounce of Goblood, it neutralizes the poison and increases the magic potential of the drinker? That was a happy accident. Bring me some and I'll show you.
