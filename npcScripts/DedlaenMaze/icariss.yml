                    Here you go. Maybe it'll do you more good than it will for me.

                Agh! I'm trapped in this maze and there's just no escaping that dreadful beast chasing me. No matter how many of these keys I have, I just can't seem to find my way out. Do me a favor and bring me the heart of the dark lord as well as the spectral pearl and I can reward you with some form of escape.
