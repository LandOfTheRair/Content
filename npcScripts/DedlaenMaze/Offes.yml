                    That's a chunky one! Bring me a piece of gear with an open upgrade slot and I'd be happy to take that rock off your hands.

                Greetings traveler. My brother and I are in search of rare chunks of titanium. We're not sure why, but they seem less rare here
                than in other parts of the world. If you bring me one, I can improve the offensive capabilities of a piece of your gear.
