                Greetings traveler. My brother and I are in search of rare chunks of titanium. 
                For some reason, the living beings of this maze seem to carry an excess of them, compared to most other places we've looked. 
                If you can bring a chunk to me, I can add some defense to your gear.

                - text: Okay, we'll see
