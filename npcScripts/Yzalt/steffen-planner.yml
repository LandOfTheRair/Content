            Greetings. I am one of the leaders of the Steffen. I maintain our relations with outsiders like yourself. If you happen to be interested in becoming more friendly with us, I might be willing to HELP.

            Yes, ${ name }, I could use your help. You see, we are at war with the Heniz in the south. They attack our town repeatedly, and our citizens are starting to panic.I would like you to help our local defenders out. You could also join our assaulters in attacking their camp. You can help us out with that, RIGHT?
