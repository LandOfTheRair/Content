            Greetings. I am one of the leaders of the Heniz people. I maintain our relations with outsiders like yourself. If you happen to be interested in becoming more friendly with our kind, I might be willing to HELP.

            Yes, ${ name }, I could use your help. You see, we are at war with the Steffen in the north. While our crazed brethren are a problem, the more pressing matter is the Steffen that attack our camp. I would like you to help our local defenders out. You could also join our assaulters in attacking their town. Can you do this for me? You'll help, RIGHT?
