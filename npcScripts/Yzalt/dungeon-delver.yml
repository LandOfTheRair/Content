                    Hmmm. This is plain sewer rat fur. If you bring me a second one, I can add the defense from one to the other.

                    Interesting! They make robes out of the straw they use to make their nests, too. I can combine the straw from two of them to make a stronger robe.

                    So they can use axes, too? They might be too dangerous to be left alone. I can sharpen one with the other to increase its damage output.
