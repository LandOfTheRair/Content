                Greetings, adventurer. We're having an issue with all sorts of creatures today, and our militia isn't equipped to handle all of it. If you help us cull their numbers, we'll split the reward with you.

                Come back when you're not so weak and we'll have work for you. Yelak over in the mines might find you more useful.
