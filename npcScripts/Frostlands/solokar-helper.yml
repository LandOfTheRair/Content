            Welcome, ${ name } to the SOLOKAR Staging Area! I am Solaman, the expert navigator here. Solokar is a slowly SHIFTING dungeon that changes appearance each day. You can enter into the dungeon by going through a portal - each portal will drop you somewhere unknown, making it a bit challenging to LEAVE, unless you DIE. We have found a lot of cool LOOT, though!

            You can leave by finding one of the four glowing portals, or the stairs! Mysteriously, the dungeon provides multiple ways to exit. If you mean to leave the Solokar Staging Area, I'm told there's an ancient portal that will take you back to Rylt, in Antania.

            Well, you end up right back here! Your gear, if lost, will be found nearby. Any items you drop are magically whisked to that location as well. We've found it prudent to bring in an expert healer to out adventurers that are new here, and the combination of his binding magic and the strange magic of Solokar allow for us to do some powerful things!

            When you enter Solokar, you can find a wide variety of items - some of which don't even exist outside of it. In the past, I've also found some treasure chests, which seem like pirate's folly, but it's true! You may also encounter some very strange and nasty foes, so be careful.

            Personally, I like the thrill of the adventure! But you seem more discerning than I - you will be on the lookout for treasure chests, other useful and unique items, and maybe more. The maze does not reveal to us all secrets, yet, but we hope one day to figure out what else it can offer.

            Solokar is a shifting dungeon. It seems that not only the layout shifts, but the fragment of time it represents changes too. Sometimes, you enter into a warzone - not unlike the Heniz and Steffen of today. Others, you're all alone in a mess of goblins. And others, yet, you find yourself in a place no mortal has laid eyes upon. The dungeon does not allow us to enter while it is shifting, but it seems to do so fairly quickly - a monumental feat, if I do say so.
