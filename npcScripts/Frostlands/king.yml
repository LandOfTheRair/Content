                Yes, I may not look it, but as far as you can see frost; you see the land in my possession. Sadly, we are overrun with all manner of BEASTS.

                Yeti, sabertooths, thermidors, and the frostsnakes. If you name it, we've got a problem with it. Never you mind the crazed wildlife to the south. In fact, we could use some help CULLING their numbers.

                Specifically, if you could rout the legendary Frostfang and bring me his hide, as well as as bringing us the SOURCE of the frozen winds of the yeti, I think a handsomely royal reward would be in order.

               Oh yes, of course, no specific yeti has the source. They share it - they certainly don't make it easy. You'll know it when you see it.
