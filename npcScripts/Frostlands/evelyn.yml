                        Hmm... it looks like there's a bit more missing at the end. Maybe there's a pattern I don't recognize yet.

                Yes! Please take this book, it was addressed to me, but found in the floes. It must be from my husband! He was last seen heading to confront the brigands. I hope nothing bad happened!
