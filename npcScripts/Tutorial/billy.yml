            Aw, shucks. Have you seen my pet Moose? It's so lonely in this town, I might have to move. There are just the MERCHANTS, the HERMIT, and me.

            Yeah. The building to the south of here has some merchants. They sell armor, weapons, and potions. Nothin' there for a kid like me, though.

            Old man Hermit is off in the distant house, northwest of here. I hear he has the key to let people out of this forsaken town, whatever that means.
