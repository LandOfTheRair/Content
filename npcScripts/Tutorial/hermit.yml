                Ah, thank you ${ name }! I see you've brought me the skull of the feared yeti. 
                Now go out into the world and do great things! The exit is to the north, through a winding cave.

            Yes, I can help you, and you can help me. If you kill the nearby YETI and bring me his SKULL - just hold it in your right hand. 
            If ya do that, I can give you a KEY to let you out of here. I can also help you find the PROFESSION trainers.

            Yes, yes. There is a yeti in the forest to the east. He plagues this small town, and no one would miss him if he were to, erm, expire. 
            You may want to dedicate to a PROFESSION before taking him on, though.

            Yeti skulls happen to be a prized item in these parts. No, I'm not some sort of weirdo! I'll trade you a KEY for his skull. 
            Just hold it in your hand, and greet me again! Note also that the skull must BELONG to you!

            Yes, yes. Some items have a faint warm sensation upon grasping them. 
            It truly is a strange phenomena, but it means that you own that item, and no one else can use it. 
            That's how I'll know you've completed your trial!
