            Hello, ${ name }! Welcome to Land of the Rair!
            I'm an encruster, and I can do two things for you: make your gear distinguishable from one another, and add stats to your gear!
            If you hold a gem and item in your hand, I can add it's stats to the item! Find my brethren in the world and they'll be able to help you more.
